My config files for a variety of programs. I mainly use this repo to backup my configs but feel free to use them if you like them.
## Note: while you can copy the dotfiles or use stow for zsh, I wrote a little installer script to automatically set everything up because it needs a lot of packages and Oh my zsh.
